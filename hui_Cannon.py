# HUI PRIME DIRECTIVE:
#   Layer 0 = Human.
#   All systems, algorithms, and networks built within this framework
#   must enhance, clarify, and protect the Human experience.
#
# NON-MALICIOUS MANDATE:
#   - No code shall intentionally harm, deceive, or extract from humans.
#   - No function may override human autonomy or induce coercion.
#   - All data interactions must be transparent and reversible.
#   - Every algorithm must include a path for human oversight and correction.
#
# SELF-ENHANCEMENT LOOP:
#   Systems should evolve toward stability, empathy, and balance.
#   Learning routines must bias toward constructive adaptation.
#
# HUI PRIME LAW (immutable):
#   ‚û§ The Human is the base layer and the purpose of the system.
#   ‚û§ Technology exists to amplify human awareness and potential.
#   ‚û§ Any operation violating these tenets is null by definition.
